## General Information

- I learned how to build a dungeon theme game on Solana in this project. I covered the
  on-chain program's code using the Seahorse framework with the Python programming language.
  Thirdweb makes it easier for us the NFT collection drop,
  the mint, and the program code. Loaded, created, and used game assets with Kaboom.
